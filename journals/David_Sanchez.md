Work with team on getting our tables correct and working in beekeeper as well as in our project itself. Ran into some trouble when doing this, but ultimately got it figured out with the help of Rosheen and Liz.

# 7/11
Worked on creating endpoints with my team, and watching videos on how to create them. Tomorrow we will work on backend auth.

# 7/12
Created my first endpoint and it was a GET Request for the personal plant detail page. It was a tricky fellow but worked out the kinks and got it to work.

# 7/13
Was able to finish and get my "PUT" plant_edit endpoint to work and fully intergrate into the project

# 7/14
Worked on my endpoints and helped my partners as well. I helped out Cindy with her endpoint. And finished up another one of mine.

# 7/17
Group finished up more endpoints and we are helping each other. We ran into a few problems but managed to get them done.

# 7/18
Finished all my endpoints FINALLY! With the help of melinda and liz but moving to backend with Melinda.

# 7/19
Melinda and I worked on backend auth, we watched the video together and went over the code numerous times. However, after getting stuck we had caleb and liz help us and it the code still didn't work. So now just need some instructor help.

# 7/20
Working with Melinda and teachers to finish backend auth and get it working properly. Going to start working on front end auth with Melinda as soon as we get backend finished.
