# 7/10
Work with team on getting our tables correct and working in beekeeper as well as in our project itself. Ran into some trouble when doing this, but ultimately got it figured out with the help of Rosheen and Liz.

# 7/11
Worked on creating endpoints with my team, and watching videos on how to create them. Tomorrow we will work on backend auth.


# 7/12
Created my first endpoint and it was a GET Request for the personal plant detail page. It was a tricky fellow but worked out the kinks and got it to work.

# 7/13
Was able to finish and get my "PUT" plant_edit endpoint to work and fully intergrate into the project
