We were pretty flustered with our wireframe and endpoints. There was a lot to think about and we were scrambling to find a direction. We received some feedback that somewhat helped.

# 6/29
We went over user stories and established database tables and relationships.

# 6/30
Dylan showed an extension on VSCode called Live Share. It was really cool to see our code being edited in real time.

# 7/10
The team worked on implementing our project in beekeeper. It was a bit confusing and difficult, but we got assistance from Rosheen and Liz.

# 7/11
We worked on an endpoint as a team and also reviewed Learn information on FastAPI.

# 7/12
Today we delegated endpoints to each team member. We also reviewed videos to clarify information on what and how to set up endpoints and using fastAPI.

# 7/13
We individually worked on our own endpoints. Whenever we had blockers we would help each other out and it was a successful method so far.

# 7/14
I had a 500 error on one of my endpoints. The group tried to help me but we were getting stuck. We asked for help and Liz came over. We were working on it for a long time, probably over an hour. Then all of a sudden I looked at my fastAPI in the background and saw that the data was sent. Not sure what we did since we made quite a few changes.

# 7/17
By now, I started to get the hang of writing endpoints. I was feeling confident today and working at a much faster rate.

# 7/18
I finished my last two endpoints today. It was a smooth and quick process.

# 7/19
Started working on my frontend endpoints. Also helped fill out and set up the nav bar.

# 7/20
Having some trouble with my frontend endpoints. They were not submitting the data.

# 7/24
David was having environmental issues that affected his ghi. We looked over all our code to see if it matched. We also merged to have the updated codes.

# 7/25
Working on one of my frontend endpoints made me realize we were missing a backend endpoint. I worked with Dylan to make a species list endpoint. Helped team work on deployment.

# 7/26
Worked on pulling up a species list for a dropdown menu. Completed that then moved on to my final frontend endpoint. I worked on the user profile page that pulls all of the user's plants they inputted themselves. Worked with SEIRs to help retrieve user id. Also worked on some unit tests.

# 7/27
Continued to work on figuring out how to retrieve user id with Rosheen and Paul. Investigated as far as going into the backend. Then worked with Dylan to go over our codes. Finally figured out how to retrieve user id with her help! :D Finished unit tests.

# 7/28
Having issues with the deployed site. But we ran the reset and now it shows the updated code. Everything is pretty much set and ready.
