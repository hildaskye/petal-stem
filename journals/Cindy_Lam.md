# 7/10
The team worked on implementing our project in beekeeper. It was a bit confusing and difficult, but we got assistance from Rosheen and Liz.

# 7/11
We worked on an endpoint as a team and also reviewed Learn information on FastAPI.

# 7/12
Today we delegated endpoints to each team member.

# 7/13
We individually worked on our own endpoints. Whenever we had blockers we would help each other out and it was a successful method so far.
